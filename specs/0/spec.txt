Kot Spec - Version 0 - Stage Alpha

TODO Allow adding of variables, currently only constants exist.

- Starter Tags
- Comments
    // = Single line.
    /* */ = Multi-line. (You cannot have a multi-line comment within another multi-line comment.)

- Types
    val is used to mark a data type as unchangable.
    var is used to mark a data type as changable. (TODO Might remove var and only have val)
    Primitive:
        Only 64 bit numbers.
        Number Type:
            - char, chr (4 bytes big)
            - int, i64
            - uint, u64
            - float, f64
            - byte, u8
        Other:
            - string, str
            - boolean, bool

    Array:
        Cannot have an array of objects.
        - Primitive[]

    Object:
        - object, obj

- Operators
    THERE IS NO CASTING.
    - .. = Append Primitives together into a string.
    - !, &&, || = Logic for booleans.
    - +, -, *, / = (byte -> char -> i64 -> u64 -> f64) Casts to biggest type then does arithmetic.
    - % = Casts a number type to u64 then evaluates.
    - ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=  = (byte -> char -> i64 -> u64 -> f64) Casts to biggest type then compares.
    - &, |, ^, ~, << u64, >> u64 = Does a bitwise operation on a number type.

- Functions
    You cannot make your own functions.
    To call a function use: fun function_name(args)
    Standard:
        - pow(number1, number2) -> number = (byte -> char -> i64 -> u64 -> f64) Casts to biggest type then does number1 ^ number2.
        - format(string, Primitive...) -> string = Puts Primitives into {}, located in the format string.

- File Extensions and names
    Kot data files = *.kot
    Kot binary files = *.kob
    Kot build file = kot.build
    Kot cache file = kot.cache
    Kot build file cache = kot.build.cache

- Compiled File
    Compiled files will hold kot data in binary and checked form. It also evaluates all experessions.

- Build File
    The build file will hold all *.kot files to be compiled.
    It will also allow each input file to be mapped to another location, as well as allowing the build folder to be moved.
    Builds using a build file will evaluate all paths from the location of the build file.

- Cache File
    The cache file just keeps a hash each *.kot file and the build file to make builds faster.
